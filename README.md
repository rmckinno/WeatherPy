## Using OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps to create a vacation itenarary.

In this module, OpenWeatherMap API is used to determine the weather attributes for over 700 locations. Then, filtering to the user's preferred location based on selected minimum and maximum temperatures. I used Google Places API seach to determine hotels near each city. With this information, chose a group of 4 locations in one country to create an itenerary using other Google APIs and adding markers to the map with gmaps and layers.
